# Elevvo Internship â€“ ML Projects  

This repository has the work I did during my internship at Elevvo. It includes four machine learning tasks: predicting student exam scores, grouping customers into segments, identifying forest cover types, and checking if a loan should be approved. Each task taught me how to prepare data, train models, and check their results in a clear and practical way.
